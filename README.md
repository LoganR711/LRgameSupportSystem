# LRgameSupportSystem
A simple and Open Source Support/Ticket system for your website
Allows you to auto-reply to the sender directly on the email. 
and it sends you the info and tells the person via email that their form has been submitted successfully.

If you wish to use it, you'll need to update the index.html to fit your website, and you'll need to update process-contact.php and add the required info.
just look for the hashtags on lines 7-10, 189, 218, 225, 265, 273, 332, 346, 349

Mind you, I use CPanel to host my website, so it's made with that in mind. I'm not sure how it will react with other hosting methods.
